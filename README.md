# Diabetes-prediction
diabetes prediction using machine learning:

1) Dataset: Use datasets like Pima Indians Diabetes Database.
2) Preprocessing:
   *Handle missing values.
   *Normalize/scale features.
   *Split into training and testing sets.
3) Model Selection:
    *Use algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, or Neural Networks.
4) Training:
   *Train the model on the training set.
5) Evaluation:
    *Test using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
6) Deployment:
Deploy the model via a web app or API for real-time predictions.
